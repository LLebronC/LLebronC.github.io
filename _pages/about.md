This page is a compilation of all the events, unfortunate or not, that led me to where I'm now.

I’m a computer vision PhD student supervised by Prof. Noel O’Connor and Dr. Kevin McGuiness, I started in March of 2019. Previously I was working in United Technology Research Center Ireland where I did my master thesis in video summarization and also worked in other topics like action recognition. Previous to that I also worked in Computer Vision Center of Barcelona (CVC-UAB) where I worked in the development of a multispectral camera.

Right now I’m interested in video captioning (the topic of my PhD) and learning NLP as much as possible. I also want to learn more about 3D reconstruction from diferent sources!
