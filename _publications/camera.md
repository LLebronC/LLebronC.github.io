excerpt: 'Traditionally the image classification and recognition have been done using grey or color images in the boundaries of the human eye, which is between the 400 mm and the 700nm, these limits produce a reduction of the information which a machine can perceive. The objective of this project is to study the effect of these images on the object's clasificaci贸n problem. The first goal of the project is to adapt a multiespectral camera cheaper than the ones that are being sold nowadays. This camera will be made using one Arduino, a black and white camera and some LED of different spectrums. The second part will consist in the study and comparison of some clasificaci贸n's algorithms in different color spaces and feature descriptors, giving the output of the multiespectral camera.'
