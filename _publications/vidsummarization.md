title: "Video summarization with LSTM and deep attention models"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/vidsummarization
excerpt: 'In this paper we propose two video summarization models based on the recently proposed vsLSTM and dppLSTM deep networks, which allow to model frame relevance and similarity. The proposed deep learning architectures additionally incorporate an attention mechanism to model user interest. In this paper the proposed models are compared to the original ones in terms of prediction accuracy and computational complexity. The proposed vsLSTM+Att method with an attention model outperforms the original methods when evaluated on common public datasets. Additionally, results obtained on a real video dataset containing terrorist-related content are provided to highlight the challenges faced in real-life applications. The proposed method yields outstanding results in this complex scenario, when compared to the original methods.'
